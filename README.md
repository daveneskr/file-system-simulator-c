# File System Simulator (C) 
**CURRENTLY WORKING ON**

A **UNIX-style file system simulator** implemented in C.  
This project replicates basic file system operations like **creating, reading, writing, deleting, and navigating files/directories**, using custom data structures.

---

## Features
- Create, rename, and delete files/directories.
- Navigate directories (`cd`, `ls`, etc.).
- Simulate hierarchical directory structure.
- Track file metadata (size, creation time).
- Save and load the entire file system from disk.

---

## Motivation
Built to deepen understanding of:
- File system design principles.
- Pointer-based data structures (trees).
- Low-level memory and storage simulation.

---

## Core Concepts
- **Tree structure** to represent directories.
- **Recursion** for navigation and display.
- **Linked lists** for files within directories.
- File serialization for persistence.
